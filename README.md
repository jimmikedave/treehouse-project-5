 Publish API Request

In this project, I worked with an API to generate a directory of 12 employees.
Employee images, names, emails, and location were pulled from a parsed JSON request.
Each employee is shown with their information and can show more when clicked on.
A modal window appears when an employee is clicked on, and you can cycle to the
next or previous employee. You can also search for an employee using the search
bar.

Style Changes
- changed background color to SeaGreen
